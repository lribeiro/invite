Agents that interact in complex social situations need to take the social 
situation in consideration in order to perform believably.

We argue that, since social identity is an important factor in the social 
situation, agents should incorporate social identity theory in their behaviour.

In addition, social situations often present social dilemmas with expected 
rational choices and social identity can influence the agent to deviate 
from the rational choice (e.g. favor other agents that share the same 
social group).

However in some situations the rational choice may be the expected. As such 
we propose that to be believable agents should take into account individual 
rationality and social bias in their decision making. In fact, we believe that 
finding the dynamics between the social bias induced by social identity and 
the rational motivation is one of the challenges of building believable 
social agents. 

Furthermore, we would like to stress that in order to be believable in social 
situations and social dilemmas agents need the ability to anticipate and take 
others in consideration, since this is a crucial point for achieving any kind 
of social intelligence.

## Social Identity

Agents that interact in complex social situations need to take the social
situation in consideration in order to perform believably, and any complex
society is fragmented in different social groups, each with its own
interests, values, structure and identity. Social Identity theory explains
how people categorize themselves as members of one social group in
comparison with another. Due to it's relevance to social behaviour, we
believe that this theory, is especially important if the aim is to build
natural intelligence and human-like behaviour.

Social identity is part of an individual's perception of a social situation.
It is the identity ascribed with basis on the perception of membership of
social groups and the attachment to that membership. It implies the
categorization of the agents (including the self) in terms of the
belongingness to social groups. Thus, apart from all individual
characteristics that build a personal identity each agent should have a
social identity comprised of all social groups they belong to.

Accordingly to this theory, the psychological process of social
identification, constitutes a basis for intragroup cooperation. Individuals
are inclined to favour other individuals with similar identities (e.g.
belonging to the same social groups) or blame others of different social
identities for the problems in a group. This can be extended to team
commitments. Social identity will influence the decision of agents when
considering following their own interests or commit (or keep the commitment)
to their team goals.

## Social Dilemmas

The formal relations involved in social dilemmas can be captured by models 
of game theory. Game theory allows modelling such social situations as 
games, that is, mathematical abstractions, deliberately simple, 
corresponding to an idealization of the actual interaction in which the 
rules and basic elements are unambiguously defined. 

Using the archetypes of game theory it is possible to have an enhanced 
understanding of how to design conflict situations in which certain external 
factors, such as the one of social identity, can be manipulated and analysed 
in detail. 

We propose a framework of social dilemmas to study both human and artificial 
behaviour. It was our intent that the framework was as general as possible to 
be able to model different scenarios and to manipulate different factors 
influencing the decisions of players. The proposed framework models a specific 
type of games, "team games" in which social identity 
assumes a more important role than in usual social dilemmas. Team games can be 
defined as games in which both the elements of inner and outer group conflicts 
are present. In such games players are assigned into groups, with each group 
facing an in-group social dilemma and an out-group strategic game (which may or 
may not be a social dilemma). In this type of games, social identity plays an 
important role since groups are not only formed but also have specific out-group 
competitive goals and according to the previous experiment it appear to have a 
significant impact upon cooperation rates. An experiment with this type of games 
was conducted by who reported that subjects were almost 
twice as likely to contribute to the group effort in team games than in isolated 
social dilemmas. It is therefore the purpose of this work that this framework 
allows designing environments where social identity and its impact upon the 
outcomes of problematic social settings can be studied.  

## Anticipation

Although different aspects of believability have been researched, all work 
supports the basic principle that motion cannot be devoid of meaning and considers 
the issue of variability over a consistent core to be of importance to manage the 
expectations of the viewer, provide the illusion of life and allow for the audience 
suspension of disbelief. This is particularly important as it stresses the 
importance of both anticipation and character personality in the creation of 
believable behaviour. By making personality-based anticipated outcomes the very 
core of the decision making process, expression can take into account this same 
outcome to provide a whole coherent behaviour for the character, one that provides 
meaning to action by disclosing the inner mental process and strengthens the 
illusion of life. 

Explicit representations of the future state of the world (i.e. not relying solely 
of past and present information) has been shown to allow the creation of synthetic 
behaviour perceived as more believable. We expect this be of importance when 
considering a scenario in which several agents and users are interacting together. 
As such, we argue that autonomous agents in social situations should consider 
predictions about the goals and plans of others in order to be perceived as 
believable. We state that because social identity and personality are central 
factors of decision in social situations they are consequently pivotal elements of 
behaviour predictive models.
